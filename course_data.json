  "course_overview": "Kubernetes helps deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. It abstracts the underlying infrastructure, so it doesn’t matter if you're deploying your applications to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Linode, or your own on-premises datacenter. \n\nIn this course, you’ll learn why we have Kubernetes, what it is, where it’s going, and how to create containerized applications. By the end of this course, you will be ready to tackle more advanced concepts and take your Kubernetes skills to the next level.",
